#### 🏳️‍🌈 About Me
I'm an editor turned self-taught front-end developer currently on the TechNative Digital Full-Stack Developer 16-week bootcamp. I am eager to turn my keen eye for design and development into a satisying and rewarding career in tech as a software developer. 

As a queer developer, I'm invested in LGBTQ+ inclusivity and diversity within tech 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
